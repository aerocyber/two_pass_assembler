<h3 id="versioning">Versioning</h3>
<p>Version 1.1: Fixes <br> Version 1.0: Initial release</p>
<h2 id="language-considerations">Language Considerations</h2>
<p>The assembler requires the source to have 3 sections per line
separated by tab.</p>
<pre><code>LABEL   MNEMONIC    OPERATOR</code></pre>
<p>In case of the lack of <code>LABEL</code>, it must be filled with
<code>-</code>. The first line MUST be:</p>
<pre><code>LABEL START ADDRESS</code></pre>
<p><code>LABEL</code> can be replaced with a suitable label,
<code>ADDRESS</code> with a HEX value.</p>
<p>The <code>OPTAB</code> has been hardcoded so as to reduce the need of
taking additional input.</p>
<p>The output of the assembler will be in the <code>build</code>
subdirectory located in the source program directory.</p>
<h2 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h2>
<p>The following OSs are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 or 11</li>
<li>Linux (any version/distro) with gtk libraries installed</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Windows Smartscreen may flag the files as unsafe. Click
<code>More Info &gt; Run Anyway</code> from the Smartscreen dialog to
run it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows installer requires administrator access if installing for
more than one user.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-the-assembler">Using the assembler</h2>
<p>Using the assembler is straight forward.</p>

<p>All that is to be done is to create the source file and provide its
path in the input field. Alternatively, save the source file and click
on the File Attach button to the right of the input field to open
<code>Open File</code> dialog box.</p>

<p>Then, click the <code>Build</code> button to build.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building will create a <code>build</code> subdirectory. If it already
exist, the entire directory is deleted and then recreated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open the directory <code>build</code> to see the output.</p>
<p>To clear the path, tap the <code>Clear fields</code> button.</p>
